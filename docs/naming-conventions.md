# Naming Conventions

## InstructLab - The Overall Project Name

* `instructlab` - in URLs, no hyphen
* `instruct-lab` - in URLs if `instructlab` is not available for some reason
  (like Slack)
* `InstructLab` - CamelCase when referring to the name of the overall project.
* Never `Instruct Lab` with a space.

## Models

* `Merlinite` and `Granite` are capitalized unless referring to a filename
  like `merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf`.
